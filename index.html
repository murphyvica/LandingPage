        <h3>About the Price Prediction Model</h3>
        <p>Our price prediction model addresses the common problem of uncertainty in determining 
            the best time to purchase a product. To solve this issue, we developed a Machine 
            Learning model that leverages thousands of historical price data points to accurately 
            predict the price of a product in the next two weeks. Our model provides graphical price 
            predictions that enable individuals to make informed purchasing decisions, leading to 
            more effective allocation of resources. By utilizing our Price Prediction Model, 
            individuals can avoid overspending, and optimize their purchasing decisions. Our 
            project demonstrates the utility of data analytics in bettering everyday finances.

        <div class="paragraph-row">
            <p> Mileena is a Senior at the UW Seattle campus studying Biology. She finds herself juggling 
                her time between school, work, and her research. Due to her busy schedule, she finds herself 
                primarily shopping online, but she's always looking for a deal so she can stay within her monthly
                 budget. Her main pain point revolves around budgeting and ensuring she gets the best deal when
                shopping online for school supplies. She saved for months to buy a new laptop only for it
                 to unexpectedly go up in price the month she planned to buy it. </p>
            <p> Mary is a Single mother from Texas. She works from home as a full stack developer 
                for an emerging tech business. When she's not working, she takes care of her 2 year 
                old daughter whom she spends a lot of time with. Due to her busy schedule, she is 
                often shopping online for everything from groceries, to children's toys, to smart 
                appliances. Her main pain point revolves around smartly spending her money. 
                She finds herself overspending on smart appliances when the same appliances' 
                prices drop in the next few weeks. She'd like a solution that would help her 
                make more informed purchasing decisions when shopping online in the future.</p>
            <p> Wendell owns NetPrism. Wendell has a passion for helping NetPrism's users and 
                future consumers know when to buy their products. He is excited about leveraging 
                the power of data to help consumers make educated decisions with their hard 
                earned money. </p>
