        <h3>About the Price Prediction Model</h3>
        <p>Our price prediction model addresses the common problem of uncertainty in determining 
            the best time to purchase a product. To solve this issue, we developed a Machine 
            Learning model that leverages thousands of historical price data points to accurately 
            predict the price of a product in the next two weeks. Our model provides graphical price 
            predictions that enable individuals to make informed purchasing decisions, leading to 
            more effective allocation of resources. By utilizing our Price Prediction Model, 
            individuals can avoid overspending, and optimize their purchasing decisions. Our 
            project demonstrates the utility of data analytics in bettering everyday finances.
